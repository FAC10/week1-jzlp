### Stretch goals
[x] optimise file size of images
  1. Reduce file size of profile images (11MB -> 70K) by resizing and optimising.
  1. Save images as progressive JPEG rather than baseline. Baseline images are images that load from top to bottom, line by line. Progressive images load in layers, starting with a blurry image, then finishing with a high-resolution layer.

[] ~~expand "team" member sections on hover~~
[] smooth jump to section (can it be done with css? go with js if needed)
[] improve security of form submission
[x] make each section fill screen
